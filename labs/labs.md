# Labs 

There are two labs that are multi-week, group-projects. Groups are typically between three and four students.

1. The first lab is a lab about sampling and hypothesis testing. For this lab, students are provided a guided set of questions and data and write the tests that produce evidence for the questions. Students will have approximately two weeks (depending on breaks that might fall mid-semester) to work on these labs.  
2. The second lab is about building linear models to answer a research question. Students will have more time to work on this lab -- between three and four weeks, with intermediate check-ins -- and the lab will form the basis of the final presentation for the course.
